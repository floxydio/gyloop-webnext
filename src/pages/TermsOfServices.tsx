                Area (the “EEA”) and will transfer your Personal Data to
                countries outside of the EEA. If these transfers are to a
                country for which the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy
                decision, SAP Ariba uses the EU standard contractual clauses to
                contractually require that your Personal Data receives a level
                of data protection consistent with the EEA. You can obtain a
                copy (redacted to remove commercial or irrelevant) of such

                deletes your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to
                use any SAP Ariba service that requires SAP Ariba’s use of your

              <br />

                based on SAP Ariba’s legitimate interest (as further set out
                below), subject to the time required for SAP Ariba to determine

                to your Personal Data, for such information to be portable, if
                possible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit
                this information to another recipient without hindrance; and to
                opt-out of the sale of Personal Data. In accordance with the
                disclosure requirements under the CCPA, SAP Ariba is exempt from
                providing a notice to opt-out because it does not and will not
                sell your Personal Data. Please note, however, that SAP Ariba
                can or will delete your Personal Data only if there is no
                statutory obligation or prevailing right of SAP Ariba to retain
                it. Kindly note further that if you request that SAP Ariba
                deletes your Personal Data, you will not be able to continue to
                use any SAP Ariba service that requires SAP Ariba’s use of your
                Personal Data.

              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                For individuals within the State of California, you may also
                exercise your rights as follows: You can call toll-free to
                submit a request using the numbers provided here. You can also
                designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise
                your data protection rights to SAP Ariba. Such authorized agent
                must be registered with the California Secretary of State and
                submit proof that you have given authorization for the agent to
                act on your behalf. If you are an Individual with a disability,
                contact SAP Ariba at the above address or toll-free phone number

              <br />
              <p>
                How will SAP Ariba verify requests to exercise data protection
                rights? SAP Ariba will take steps to ensure that it verifies
                your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty before it will
                process the data protection right you want to exercise. When
                feasible, SAP Ariba will match Personal Data provided by you in
                submitting a request to exercise your rights with information
                already maintained by SAP Ariba. This could include matching two
                or more data points you provide when you submit a request with
                two or more data points that are already maintained by SAP
                Ariba.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In accordance with the verification process set forth in the
                California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), SAP Ariba will require
                a more stringent verification process for deletion requests, or
                for Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, to
                minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized
                access or deletion of your Personal Data. If SAP Ariba must
                request additional information from you outside of information
                that is already maintained by SAP Ariba, SAP Ariba will only use
                it to verify your identity so you can exercise your data
                protection rights, or for security and fraud-prevention
                purposes.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                SAP Ariba will decline to process requests that are manifestly
                unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required
                by local law.
              </p>

                is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the
                requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable data
                protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the
                data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or

                SAP Ariba has its registered seat.
